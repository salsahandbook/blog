Summary: This article explains the salsa dance position.


> DRAFT VERSION.  WORK IN PROGRESS


Positions are a fundamental element of partner dance. Salsa dance elements include the following:

* Steps
* Handholds
* Turns
* Combs
* Stylings
* Positions
* Patterns
* Combinations


#### What is a position
A salsa dance position comprises the orientation of the dancers with respect to each other and the handhold.

Aspects of dancer orientation include what direction each dancer is facing, at what level are the hands held, and the direction of eye gaze.


#### Why is the dance position important
Every salsa dance pattern begins and ends in a dance position. One can view salsa dance as the artful transition through a series of positions. Expert salsa dancers know how to get into and out of myriad salsa dance positions in interesting ways. Knowing how to do this can help increase your salsa dance repertoire.  This is facilitated by knowing your dance positions.


#### How does the position fit into patterns and combinations
A salsa dance combination is comprised of two or more salsa dance patterns, each pattern covering two bars of music. Every salsa dance pattern begins and ends in a dance position. The salsa dance pattern is a transition from a start position to an end position over eight beats of music. Because salsa dance is made up of combinations, and combinations are made up of patterns, one can view salsa dance as an aesthetically pleasing progression through a series of dance positions over the course of a song. 



We refer to the leader as Leader.  We refer to the follower as Follower.

* Facing Each Other (FEO)
* Facing Opposite Directions (FOD)
* Side By Side (SBS)
* Leader In Front (LIF)
* Leader In Back (LIB)
* Leader On Right (LOF)
* Leader On Left (LOL)


Half closed position:
- FEO, LRH on Follower left upper back, FLH on LLS.

Apart, FEO.

The most common position is Open Position.  It is actually just one kind of open position. An open position is any position involving a handhold that is not a closed position.  However, because this is by far the most common open position, and because the other open positions all tend to have their own distinctive name, this position is usually called just "Open Position". 

<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Open_LLHS.PNG" width="150" height="262" /></div></p>

This particular open position is used so often it is often referred to simply as **Open Position**.


### Right to Left
The most common position in which this handhold is used is shown here, and is known as **Half Open, Right to Left**.

<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Half_Open_R_to_L_LLHS.PNG" width="150" height="262" /></div></p>


### Left to Right
The most common position in which this handhold is used is shown here, and is known as **Half Open, Left to Right**.


<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Half_Open_L_to_R_LLHS.PNG" width="150" height="262" /></div></p>



### Right to Right
The most common position in which this handhold is used is shown here, and is known as **Handshake**.


<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Handshake_LLHS.PNG" width="150" height="262" /></div></p>


### Left to Left
The most common position in which this handhold is used is shown here, and is known as **Reverse Handshake**


<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Reverse_Handshake_LLHS.PNG" width="150" height="262" /></div></p>

### Left to Left, Right to Right. LRH/LLH
The most common position in which this handhold is used is shown here, and is known as **Crosshold**


<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Crosshold_LLHS.PNG" width="150" height="262" /></div></p>

Here is how this handhold appears from an overhead view:

<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Crosshold_overhead.PNG" width="300" height="262" /></div></p>




### Left to Left, Right to Right. LLH/LRH
This is a variation of the crosshold, where Leader's left hand is over Leader's right hand. This position is also known as **Reverse Crosshold**. However, not everyone might know that term, so sometimes it is just referred to as "left to left, right to right, left over right".

<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Reverse_Crosshold_LLHS.PNG" width="150" height="262" /></div></p>

Here is how this handhold appears from an overhead view:

### Left to Right, Right to Left, LLH/LRH
Here is one of the more unusual handholds.  It is sometimes called a **Reverse Parallel Hold**; however it is actually a kind of parallel hold but where the hands are crossed. 


> Note on naming: truthfully there doesn't seem to be a standard name for this handhold. This is one of those handholds where it can be simpler to just explicitly describe the hold, as in "right to left, left to right, left over right". Or, for its inverse variation, as "right to left, left to right, right over left". A better common name might be "Crossed Parallel". 


<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Reverse_Parallel_Hold_LLHS.PNG" width="300" height="471" /></div></p>

Here is a closeup view:

Here is how this handhold appears from an overhead view:

<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Reverse_Parallel_Hold_overhead.PNG" width="350" height="262" /></div></p>

You might ask, do people really get into that hold? Is it useful? The answer would be yes, and yes. This handhold can be entered when performing a double handed turn. The other variation of this where LRH/LLH is obtained when perfoming the double turn in the opposite spin direction.


## Applications

When you adjust the orientation of the dancers, these handholds suddenly transform into interesting positions.

Here is a Right to Left, Left to Right hand hold at high level. This is essentially the same handhold as is used in the standard open position. Only the orientation of the dancers and the height level of the handhold has changed.

<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/fsd_lib_reverse_parallel_hold_high.png" width="150" height="262" /></div></p>


Here is a Left to Left, Right to Right handhold, where the dancers are facing the same direction, with Leader in back, and Follower in front.

<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Butterfly_FSD_LIB_High.PNG" width="150" height="262" /></div></p>

Here is another Left to Left, Right to Right handhold, where the dancers are facing the same direction and side by side.

<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Closed_R_to_R_Hammerlock_SBS_LOL.PNG" width="150" height="262" /></div></p>

Here is yet another Left to Left, Right to Left handhold, where the dancers are facing the same direction and with Leader in front, Follower in back.

<p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/Positions/Half_L_Butterfly__Half_R_Self_Neck_Loop_LOW.PNG" width="150" height="262" /></div></p>

Because the last three positions are using the same handhold, you might guess that there is a way to transition from each of these positions to each of the others -- and you would be right. This is one of the fun aspects of salsa dance, figuring out how to enter and exit positions in interesting ways.

### Summary

Many salsa dance positions involve a handhold. One way to quickly breakdown a dance position is to observe whether it involves a handhold, and if so, which one.
