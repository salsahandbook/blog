# PICK YOUR FAVORITE ILLUSTRATION MODEL

Dear reader. 

I have a favor to ask of you. I am redoing all of the illustrations in my books. I am about to re-render all of the illustrations with new models.  Could you kindly take a moment and tell me your favorite models by tweeting me at **@salsahandbook**?  Your feedback would be appreciated very much.


For the new illustrations I am using stylized characters to model the dance poses.  I have narrowed it down to four `Leader` models and three `Follower` models, along with eight different `Follower` wardrobes and five different `Leader` wardrobes. Nine pairings of these model and wardrobe combinations are shown below.


**Please express your preference!**  

Just scroll down to see the choices.

We value your opinion!



> THANK YOU!

# WHY

I've published several reference books about salsa dance. Links are provided below in the More Reading section. 

I illustrated those books using a quick and easy posing tool called Magic Poser. This was the best posing tool for what I needed at the time. However the salsa handbooks have now outgrown that tool.

> I very highly recommend Magic Poser. It provided pluggable body, hair, and wardrobe combinations, allowed posing two models simultaneously, and was very easy to use. The inverse kinematics of their rigged characters is excellent. I was able to create all of those poses using touch gestures on an iPhone 5s.

It was time to bite the bullet and learn a software that could provide flexibility I wanted to have to improve these illustrations. I have finally ramped up the rather steep learning curve on that software.  I am now in the final stage. The next step is to choose from among several candidate models to pick the ones to use for re-rendering the illustrations.
