This format is an ebook that contains embedded videos. Each animated video demonstrates a dance element, such as a dance pattern, step, or handhold. Most dance elements are shown from more than one camera angle.

## Why the videobook?

The videobook is ideal for visual learners. Some people learn by watching a demonstration.  Some people learn best by imitating in real time.


## Scrubbable video
Each animation can be "scrubbed". Moving the cursor or playhead across the video timeline manually is called video scrubbing. Scrubbing is a great way to review the video at your own pace, something that can be a challenge to do with other video content.


## How to use video scrubbing?
It is super easy -- barely an inconvenience. All you need to do is move your cursor above the scrub bar and drag it in the desired direction to navigate through video clips.  


## Succinct text
Each video is accompanied with just enough text to explain each video. Links are provided to longer form content that goes into more depth or provides additional context.


## Streamlined presentation
Having perused hundreds of instructional salsa dance videos, I can attest to how challenging it can be for a beginner to follow the movements demonstrated by even the best professional salsa dance instructors. Many dance instructors are well suited to teaching intermediate to advanced level dancers; however they often use styling that is overkill for the beginner.  Beginners can get confused by elaborate stylings or lose sight of what essential.
