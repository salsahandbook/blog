## How to support this project?

I want to make many more of these dance patterns and combinations available to you in this way. This is a labor of love for me!  It costs far more to produce this content than is earned in book sales. You can help spread the salsa love by hitting the button below.

## Why the videobook?

Some people say that they wish they had a simple ebook that they could play on their phone in their browser that teaches salsa in a simple easy way without having to wade through pages of text and without having to sit through minutes of video to get to the demonstration.  Other people would like to see a combination from more than one angle.

The videobook is ideal for visual learners. If you learn by watching a demonstration, this is great for you.  If you can learn by imitating in real time.


## Scrubbable video
You can "scrub" each animation. Moving the cursor or playhead across the video timeline manually is called video scrubbing. Scrubbing is a great way for you to review the video at your own pace, something that can be a challenge to do with other video content.


## How to use video scrubbing?
It is super easy -- barely an inconvenience. All you need to do is move your cursor above the scrub bar and drag it in the desired direction to navigate through video clips.  


## Succinct text
Each video is accompanied with just enough text to explain each video. Links send you to longer form content that goes into more depth or provides additional context.


## Streamlined presentation
Having perused hundreds of instructional salsa dance videos, I can attest to how challenging it can be for a beginner to follow the movements demonstrated by even the best professional salsa dance instructors. Many dance instructors are well suited to teaching intermediate to advanced level dancers; however they often use styling that is overkill for the beginner.  Beginners can get confused by elaborate stylings or lose sight of what is essential.
